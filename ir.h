// kTimeout is the Nr. of milli-Seconds of no-more-data before we consider a
// message ended.
// This parameter is an interesting trade-off. The longer the timeout, the more
// complex a message it can capture. e.g. Some device protocols will send
// multiple message packets in quick succession, like Air Conditioner remotes.
// Air Coniditioner protocols often have a considerable gap (20-40+ms) between
// packets.
// The downside of a large timeout value is a lot of less complex protocols
// send multiple messages when the remote's button is held down. The gap between
// them is often also around 20+ms. This can result in the raw data be 2-3+
// times larger than needed as it has captured 2-3+ messages in a single
// capture. Setting a low timeout value can resolve this.
// So, choosing the best kTimeout value for your use particular case is
// quite nuanced. Good luck and happy hunting.
// NOTE: Don't exceed kMaxTimeoutMs. Typically 130ms.

// accidentally swallow repeated messages in the rawData[] output.
//
// const uint8_t kTimeout = kMaxTimeoutMs;
// This will set it to our currently allowed maximum.
// Values this high are problematic because it is roughly the typical boundary
// where most messages repeat.
// e.g. It will stop decoding a message and start sending it to serial at
//      precisely the time when the next message is likely to be transmitted,
//      and may miss it.

// Set the smallest sized "UNKNOWN" message packets we actually care about.
// This value helps reduce the false-positive detection rate of IR background
// noise as real messages. The chances of background IR noise getting detected
// as a message increases with the length of the kTimeout value. (See above)
// The downside of setting this message too large is you can miss some valid
// short messages for protocols that this library doesn't yet decode.
//
// Set higher if you get lots of random short UNKNOWN messages when nothing
// should be sending a message.
// Set lower if you are sure your setup is working, but it doesn't see messages
// from your device. (e.g. Other IR remotes work.)

// Note: Default is 25(%). Going to a value >= 50(%) will cause some protocols
//       to no longer match correctly. In normal situations you probably do not
